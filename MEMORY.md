# Memory — Monthly Expense Tracker

## Project Overview
Monthly expense tracker for a single worker built with **Flet (Python + Flutter)**. Local SQLite storage, no login, no cloud.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.12
- **Framework:** Flet 0.85.3
- **Storage:** SQLite (`expenses.db`, auto-created)
- **Build:** GitHub Actions → APK artifact

## Data Model
- `ExpenseMonth`: id, year, month, is_closed, closed_at, created_at
- `Expense`: id, month_id (FK), amount, category, note, date
- `settings`: key (PK), value — key-value config store (whatsapp_enabled, whatsapp_last_sent)
- UNIQUE(year, month) constraint on ExpenseMonth
- `DB_PATH` now uses `FLET_APP_STORAGE_DATA` env var (set by Flutter → getApplicationDocumentsDirectory)

## Key Design Decisions
| Decision | Chosen | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Platform | Flet desktop + Android | Desktop dev, mobile deploy, Python (familiar) |
| Periods | Monthly | Worker gets paid at month end |
| Month change | Auto-detect | On July 1st, auto-close June, start July fresh |
| Close Month | Manual button | Worker controls when payment is received |
| Categories | Dropdown (Tea/Water/Biscuit/Snack/Transport/Cartoon/Petrol) + custom text field | Both options always visible |
| Date picker | Yes, with calendar widget | Worker requested date selection |
| Note field | Removed by user request | Was added, then removed |
| Storage | SQLite | Simple, ACID, no server |
| Build | GitHub Actions | 8GB RAM laptop too slow for local Android build |
| WhatsApp | Android Share Intent (semi-auto) | Worker opens app daily, toggle ON, WorkManager fires at 8AM, opens share sheet for WhatsApp |
| Template | Custom cookiecutter template in repo (`flet_template/`) | Needed to inject WorkManager + share_plus + sqflite Flutter dependencies and Dart code |

## Features Implemented
- [x] Add expense (amount + category/custom + date)
- [x] Expense list grouped by date
- [x] Month total (text + button with dialog)
- [x] Close Month (with confirmation dialog)
- [x] Auto-detect month change (closes previous, creates current)
- [x] History view (all months with totals, tap to see details)
- [x] Input validation (amount > 0, future date warning)
- [x] Error handling (DB errors caught with snackbar/dialog)
- [x] None-safe `.value` handling for mobile (`(control.value or "").strip()` pattern)
- [x] `refresh_expenses()` wrapped in try/except to prevent UI freeze
- [x] Build pipeline (GitHub Actions → APK)
- [x] WhatsApp daily summary (toggle in Settings, WorkManager background task at 8AM, share_plus intent)
- [x] Custom Flutter template (flet_template/ with WorkManager + share_plus + sqflite)
- [x] DatePicker single instance (fixed overlay accumulation bug — date picker no longer "stuck")
- [x] All feedback uses AlertDialog (snackbars invisible on mobile — replaced everywhere)
- [x] WhatsApp "Send Yesterday" queries all months (not just active month, finds expenses across month boundaries)

## Flet Version-Specific Gotchas
- `page.open()` → does NOT exist. Use `page.dialog = dlg; dlg.open = True; page.update()`
- `ft.alignment.center` → does NOT exist as attribute. Use `ft.alignment.center` not on `flet.controls.alignment`
- `TextField(prefix_text=...)` → NOT supported. Use `label="Amount (₹)"` instead
- `DatePicker` → use `page.overlay.append(dp); dp.open = True; page.update()` (not `page.open(dp)`)
- Custom template: `--template ./flet_template` — template dir must have `cookiecutter.json` at root
- Template omits non-Android platforms (ios/, linux/, macos/, windows/, web/) — safe for APK-only builds
- WorkManager: `callbackDispatcher` must be top-level with `@pragma('vm:entry-point')`
- `share_plus` v12.0.2: `SharePlus.instance.share(ShareParams(text:, subject:))` — v7 API `Share.share()` removed
- `sqflite` + Python's `sqlite3` access the same `.db` file — SQLite handles concurrent access via locking
- `FLET_APP_STORAGE_DATA` = `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory().path` (set by Flutter, available in Python)
- `TextField.value` can be `None` on Android → always use `(control.value or "").strip()` pattern
- `refresh_expenses()` must be wrapped in try/except — any exception there freezes the save button silently
- Snackbars can be invisible on mobile (overlapped by nav bars) → always use AlertDialog for ALL user feedback (not just important messages)
- DatePicker: create ONE instance and append to `page.overlay` once; reuse it each time. Never create a new DatePicker on each click — multiple overlays break the picker
- AlertDialog helper pattern: define a reusable `show_alert(title, message)` that creates a dialog, assigns to `page.dialog`, opens it, and calls `page.update()`. Avoid inline `page.snack_bar` entirely for mobile targets
- DatePicker timezone: Flutter's `DatePicker` returns midnight **local time** but Flet serializes it to UTC. For users in IST (UTC+5:30), selecting June 29 sends `2026-06-28T18:30:00Z`. Always handle timezone-aware datetimes in `set_date()`: `d.astimezone().date()` converts to local time first

## GitHub Actions
- Workflow: `.github/workflows/build-apk.yml`
- Trigger: push to `main` OR manual `workflow_dispatch`
- APK output: `build/apk/` → uploaded as artifact `expense-tracker-apk`
- Build command: `flet build apk --project expense_tracker --product "Expense Tracker" --org com.expensetracker --template ./flet_template --yes`
- Simplified workflow (removed setup-java, setup-android — Flet handles these)

## To Run Locally
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install flet
python main.py
```

## To Build APK (on a powerful machine or CI)
```bash
pip install flet
flet build apk --project expense_tracker --product "Expense Tracker" --org com.expensetracker --template ./flet_template --yes
```

## WhatsApp Daily Summary — How It Works
1. **Python/Flet UI:** Settings page with toggle → writes `whatsapp_enabled` to SQLite `settings` table
2. **Custom Flutter template** (`flet_template/`): injects `workmanager`, `share_plus`, `sqflite` into Flutter project
3. **App start** (Flutter `main.dart`): calls `Workmanager().initialize(callbackDispatcher)`, schedules periodic task every 24h with initial delay to next 8:00 AM
4. **Background task** (`background_task.dart`):
   - Opens SQLite at `{getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()}/expenses.db`
   - Checks `whatsapp_enabled` → skips if false
   - Checks `whatsapp_last_sent` → skips if already today
   - Queries yesterday's expenses for active month
   - Formats: `📅 Yesterday's Expenses (Jun 28)\n\nTea\n  • ₹50.00\n...\n─────────────\nTotal: ₹150.00`
   - Calls `SharePlus.instance.share(ShareParams(text:, subject:))` → Android system share sheet → user taps WhatsApp
   - Writes `whatsapp_last_sent = YYYY-MM-DD`
5. **Test button:** "Send Yesterday's Now" in Settings — same formatting, uses `page.launch_url(f"whatsapp://send?text={encoded}")` for direct WhatsApp open (shows AlertDialog if no yesterday expenses)

## Build Fix History
### Session 1 — WHatsApp Feature + Build Debugging
- **Issue:** Flet 0.85.3 requires `share_plus ^12.0.1` but template had `^7.2.2`
- **Fix:** Bumped to `^12.0.2`, updated Dart API from `Share.share()` → `SharePlus.instance.share(ShareParams(...))`
- **Issue:** `flutter_launcher_icons` missing from pubspec → Flet CLI `KeyError`
- **Fix:** Restored dev_deps with `flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.14.1` but set `ios: false` (template strips ios/ dir)
- **Issue:** `workmanager ^0.5.2` uses deprecated Flutter v1 embedding APIs (Registrar, PluginRegistrantCallback)
- **Fix:** Bumped to `^0.9.0`, updated API: `NetworkType.not_required` → `NetworkType.notRequired`, `ExistingWorkPolicy` → `ExistingPeriodicWorkPolicy`
- **Issue:** Button callbacks silently fail on Android — `TextField.value` can be `None`, `refresh_expenses()` exceptions freeze UI
- **Fix:** Defensive `(control.value or "").strip()` pattern, try/except around `refresh_expenses()`, AlertDialog instead of snackbar for WhatsApp empty state

### Session 2 — DatePicker Overlay Bug + WhatsApp Cross-Month + AlertDialog Everywhere
- **Issue:** DatePicker gets "stuck" after repeated taps — multiple `DatePicker` instances accumulate in `page.overlay`, breaking the picker
- **Fix:** Create ONE `DatePicker` instance at component scope, append to `page.overlay` once, reuse in `pick_date()`
- **Issue:** WhatsApp "Send Yesterday's Now" doesn't find expenses — queries by `active_month.id` but yesterday's expenses may be in a different (closed) month
- **Fix:** Added `get_all_yesterday_expenses()` in `database.py` — queries ALL months for yesterday's date via `WHERE date = ?` without month filter
- **Issue:** WhatsApp button shows no feedback on mobile — if `get_yesterday_expenses` returns empty, the AlertDialog may be invisible; no error on launch failure
- **Fix:** Wrapped entire `send_test_whatsapp` in try/except with AlertDialog for "Opening WhatsApp...", no-expenses, and error cases
- **Issue:** All snackbar feedback invisible on mobile — success, error, and validation messages hidden behind nav bars
- **Fix:** Replaced ALL `page.snack_bar` calls with `show_alert(title, message)` helper (AlertDialog). Covers save_expense (success + all validation errors), refresh_expenses, confirm_close_month, and auto-close month change
- **Issue:** DatePicker shows wrong date — selecting June 29 shows June 28 in the app
- **Root cause:** Flutter's DatePicker returns midnight **local time**. Flet serializes it to **UTC** via messagepack. For IST (UTC+5:30), June 29 00:00 IST = June 28 18:30 UTC. `datetime.fromisoformat("2026-06-28T18:30:00Z")` gives a timezone-aware datetime, and `.date()` returns June 28, not June 29
- **Fix:** In `set_date()`, check if `d` is a `datetime` with `tzinfo`. If so, call `d.astimezone().date()` to convert to local timezone before extracting the date. Also handle naive datetime (`.date()`) and bare `date` objects
- **Side effect:** This also fixes the "save button doesn't work for past dates" — the expense was actually saving but with the wrong (shifted) date, so the user looked for June 29 and didn't find it
- **Issue:** WhatsApp button does nothing on Android APK
- **Root cause:** `page.launch_url("whatsapp://send?text=...")` uses a custom URL scheme that `url_launcher` in Flutter does not always handle reliably
- **Fix:** Replaced with `https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=...` — this opens WhatsApp Web on desktop and redirects to the native app on Android. Also added expense count to the success alert so user can confirm data was found before the URL launch

## Next Steps (Current)
1. Install latest APK from GitHub Actions (triggered on push) on phone
2. Test: add expense for a past date — should save with visible AlertDialog confirmation
3. Test: tap "Send Yesterday's Now" in Settings — should open WhatsApp with yesterday's expenses (now queries ALL months, not just active month)
4. Verify WorkManager fires at 8:00 AM (or change phone time to test)
5. If save still fails, check adb logcat for Python/Dart exceptions

## Future Ideas
- Category presets configurable in Settings
- Export to CSV/PDF
- Edit/delete existing expense
- Backup DB to Google Drive
